This code trains and evaluates both decision trees and random forests for classification and regression using the heart disease dataset. It starts by loading and cleaning the data, then splits it for both classification (predicting heart disease) and regression (predicting age using other features). The code trains decision tree and random forest models for each task, prints their performance metrics (accuracy and mean squared error), and visualizes the decision trees. Feature importance is also shown for both models, highlighting which features most influence predictions. This approach demonstrates how tree-based models work for both classification and regression, how to control overfitting by limiting tree depth, and how to interpret and visualize model results.
